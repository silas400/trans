At the college level, transgender athletes are estimated to make up less than 1.3% of athletes. This shows that while participation exists, the share is comparatively limited.</p>

                <p>Historical accounts and scholarship show that more than 150 pre-colonial Native American tribes acknowledged third genders in their communities. These identities often had distinct cultural, social, and spiritual roles, reflecting a broader understanding of gender fluidity compared to European societies.</p>

                <p>European colonizers condemned same-sex relationships and gender variance as sinful, imposing Christian norms to suppress Indigenous traditions. This resulted in marginalization for Native communities both for their ethnic identity and for expressions of gender and sexuality.</p>

                <p>While cultural attitudes and legal recognition vary, transgender and gender-diverse people are present across societies worldwide. Legal gender recognition (LGR) highlights this reality: some countries protect self-determination, while others impose medical, legal, or even criminal barriers. From Argentina to New Zealand, South Africa to Pakistan, recent reforms show growing acknowledgment of transgender lives, even as challenges remain in many places.</p>
